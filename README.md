## What is osu!mapping Elo rating?

osu!mapping Elo rating is an evaluation indicator based on the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to assess osu! mappers' skill by analysing the results of convincing mapping contests.

## How to check a mapper's Elo rating?

## How much can a contest affect my Elo rating?

To be counted into the Elo system, contests must meet these rules:
* Open access of information. (We can check the information of this contest, including the hosts, judges, participants, detailed results)
* Not an Aspire contest. (Judging should be under the Ranking Criteria)
* Have a certain amount of judges, including some (Ex-) BN/QATs. (To keep a high level of judging)
* The result is not based on the community votes.
* Other general rules.

According to the composition of the judges who finish scoring at last and other conditions, we divide contests into four classes (dans):
- D1: 4 or more judges, including 2 or more (Ex-) BN/QATs. 
- D2: 4 or more judges, including 2 or more (Ex-) BN/QATs.
- D3: 5 or more judges, including 3 or more (Ex-) BN/QATs.
- D4: 6 or more judges, including 4 or more (Ex-) BN/QATs.

* D1 is prepared for some test-like competition that only acquires participants to do part jobs like hitsounding or placing notes with certain rhythm, or map a short song / part of song less than 1 minute. The most existed contests are D2/D3/D4.

Contest management and judging must be fair. Issues like unreasonable scoring will cause the contest to be disqualified from system or get dan penalty.

Dan of the contest affect the K-factor in the Elo system. In a D1/D2/D3/D4 contest, the maximum ratings change is a little less than 100/200/300/400 points with infinite participants.
- Generally speaking, the more people who participate in the competition, the higher ratings winner will increase.

If a contest contains 2 or more songs to be competed, each song will be considered as a single contest.
- Exceptions: If a contest acquires mappers to map all the songs that hosts provided, it is still considered as a single one. Besides, this contest may have +1 dan if not a D4 one because mapping multiple songs may demonstrate mappers' level more effectively.
